## The Pixelbook Experience

I recently got my hands on the Pixelbook, which is Google's premier Chromebook experience device. I have a lot of thoughts that I wanted to put together in a quick post. 

1) **The Pixelbook is the best laptop hardware that I have ever used.** 

Everything from the subtle soft-touch palm area to the fantastic keyboard and trackpad are pleasant to use. The hinge feels solid and capable of the mixed modes for the device (tablet, laptop, and angled). The keyboard has great travel and the dedicated google assistant and search buttons are nice touches. 

2) **The Android app experience, while necessary, is a bit muddled.** From an overall view, the inclusion of Android apps are both necessary and functional. Apps that only exist in an Android application format are now available to use and I have several that I have enjoyed having access to use such as : Hue, Nine (email client), Lightroom CC, and Sonos. All of these applications work well enough, but there are some scaling issues and overall application design quirks that make the overall experience still feel a bit half-baked. This is not the fault of Google per say, as they are pushing for more universally functional design with their Material Design guidelines (that were updated this year), but developers are going to need time to catch up.

One other piece about the Android app integration is that there is still some confusion with the inclusion of two app stores. You have the Google Play Android store, and then the Google Play Web store, which of course have differing application options available. 

Thinking to the future, Google *needs* to clean up this separation, and unify both Chrome extensions and Android applications under a single store as the end user experience can be a bit confusing. In addition, it would be nice to see Google automatically provide the "preferred" application experience of either a website link/Chrome extension or full on application when using a unified app store, For instance, right now I have the Google Photos PWA "installed" as well as the Google Photos android application. The reason for both installs? The Google Photos Android application can see local photos without backup while the web application obviously cannot. I would also like to see a "Chrome OS optimized" flag if an Android application is built to work with ChromeOS. 

Overall, I like what Google is doing with the addition of Android applications to ChromeOS, but I would really like to see them take the next step of consolidating and simplifying the overall user experience. 

3) **The need for a "full" OS is misleading, and the Pixelbook proves that... for the most part.** Admittedly, 90% of my daily and personal use workflow take place within the browser. I have the Pixelbook as a personal "at-home" device and for any work I need to do I have the option of a VM that I can connect to via Chrome or the Horizon application. 

There are still some overall OS quirks I'd like to see fixed such as the handling of .zip files. I am okay with the way that ChromeOS will auto-mount zips, but the extraction process is seemingly unavailable? without the use of a third party file browser/app (I recommend Solid Explorer). 

Also, I'm still trying to figure out some workflows such as photo management, but progress is being made with the Lightroom CC Android application. 

4) **Despite the quirks mentioned, the Pixelbook is an absolute joy to use.** I love being able to use Lightroom CC and the other collection of Android and chrome applications available. Chrome runs at a level of smoothness I've only experienced on the Pixelbook. And most impressively, the Pixelbook is now the first device I grab when I'm wanting to do some quick photo management, or type up a quick email when I'm at home or on the go. 

There are tons of great reviews and write-ups out there that I'd direct anyone interested to check out:
