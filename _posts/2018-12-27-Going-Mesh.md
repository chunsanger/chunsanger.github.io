##### or how I switched to Eero and never looked back...

When I moved into my quad level house built in the 60's nearly 10 years ago I never worried about wireless... I thought, I have a few wireless devices and they were normally fine in our apartment so I'll be good, right? 

Then Netflix happened, and smartphones gained quicker in popularity, then Alexa and the rest is history. Suddenly our entire house needed to have strong, consistent wireless signal. Pulling this off inside a quad-level home was no easy feat, so I set to work on getting the whole house wired for quality wireless connectivity. I ran ethernet inside and out, and put in network switches and a single Asus RT-AC66U. After a month or two of questionable wireless strength, signal, and quality and overwhelming frustration I came to the realization that this router would become the single worst purchase of my entire life. 

2016 - Like a beacon of shining light, the TP-Link OnHub was released and I thought my networking issues were solved. I junked the RT-AC66U and quickly swapped in the OnHub. And while there was no question the OnHub was an improvement, it still was not maintaining strong signals in our upstairs where we had Nest Cams installed as baby monitors. 

2017 - Google releases Google WiFi, essentially a smaller packaged On-Hub with built in mesh capabilities that worked in tandem with my existing OnHub. I jumped on this solution, and picked up a three pack of Google Wi-Fi access points. After getting them installed, I saw drastic improvement in most areas of my network, but my top level still continued to have issues, and I would intermittently see drops in my connection when navigating between levels of my house (where I had a different OnHub/Google WiFi installed). 

2018 - I had followed Eero since it was introduced in 2015, but wasn't sure if I could trust a small startup with the important (and difficult) task of handling my Wi-Fi.  In 2018, I finally caved and a three pack of Eero's Pros landed on my doorstep. Immediately I was going to be losing an access point (something that concerned me) compared to the Google WiFi setup I had installed, but I wanted to take the risk based on the [great](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wi-fi-mesh-networking-kits/) [things](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kill-your-wi-fi-dead-zones-the-best-mesh-systems-for-your-home-1544027154) that I had heard about Eero. After caving in, I plugged everything in, and to my surprise the setup was even easier then the Google Wi-Fis that I had previously configured. I hooked up the three Eero Pros and began testing. Eero was showing stronger and more consistent wifi throughout my entire house, to the point where even upstairs I was seeing better speeds (by more then 10X) then I was seeing with Google WiFi. There were however some obvious pros/cons to each setup which I've outlined below: 

**Pros (Eero)**

- Easy setup
- Faster speeds then Google WiFi
- More consistent connection (no dropped access points)
- Better/quicker handoff between access points
- Eero Plus has true benefit to many users (includes built in ad-blocking, malware blocking, 1Password subscription, and VPN subscription)



**Cons (Eero)**

- Lack of ability to test connectivity of individual devices. 

  - Google Wifi has the ability to select a device and see the download and upload speed of the individual device

- Missing network usage statistics for individual devices (this is possibly coming in the future)

  - Google WiFi has an option to see which devices are using the most data on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis

- Lack of web interface (this is the same with Google WiFi)


Regardless of the cons mentioned above, the Eero has been probably the greatest tech purchase in our household for 2018. I would highly recommend it to family and friends as my new go-to suggestion for a mesh router system.
